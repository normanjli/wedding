          Kaitlin Krumwiede and Norman Li, soon to be Kaitlin Miao and Norman
          Miao (more on that later), are some California transplants to Salt
          Lake City, Utah.

          They attended the same highschool, Class of 2013 at Rim of the World
          High School. While Kaitlin and Norman aren&apos;t highschool
          sweet-hearts, they reconnected as adults. Their relationship weathered
          covid and a move to SLC, UT. They decided to spend the rest of their
          lives together and got two cats and bought a house in April, 2022.

        <h3>Why Miao?</h3>
        <Text>
          Miao is pronounced mi&apos;a ä, like meow. While they do own some cats,
          the source of their new last name is from Norman&apos;s Mother&apos;s
          maiden name!
